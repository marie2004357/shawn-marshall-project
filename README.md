This website is my front end project for code louisville it contains some of my art work for my portfolio.  My pages include 
a contact page that demonstrates an interactive component that when the Join button is clicked an "under construction message" displays.  This button and message was created with html and javascript.  I also have an About the Artist page that tells a little bit about me. All of my pages have been styled using css.
